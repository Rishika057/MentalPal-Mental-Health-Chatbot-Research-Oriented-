🧠 MentalPal: Mental Health Chatbot

A Python-based research chatbot designed to assist users with mental health support. Built from scratch using **NLP preprocessing** and **sequence modeling (RNN/CNN/LSTM)**. Fully research-oriented. No APIs used.

✨ Features
* 🗣️ Understands user text input and responds contextually
* 🤖 Uses RNN, CNN, and LSTM models for sequence learning
* 📝 Custom preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, and padding
* 🎲 Handles multiple intents with random response selection
* 💡 Great for learning NLP and conversational AI from scratch

📊 Model Performance
The models were trained and monitored for accuracy and loss over epochs.
